# Predicting Student Success Using Supervised Machine Learning

**Evidence from the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset**

## Project Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict student outcomes (Pass, Fail, Withdrawn, Distinction) in online courses using the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD). The analysis combines demographic information, course enrollment data, VLE engagement metrics, and assessment performance to build predictive models that can support early intervention systems.

## Key Results

- **Best Model**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Performance**: 67.42% accuracy, 0.6614 weighted F1, 0.8836 ROC-AUC
- **Strong Predictions**: 86% recall for Pass, 71% recall for Withdrawn
- **Challenge Areas**: 38% recall for Fail (30% misclassified as Pass)
